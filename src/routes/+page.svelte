  I'm currently an undergrad student at NC State University, where I study
  computer science with a focus on <b
    >full-stack development, DevOps, and platform engineering</b
  >. Outside of school, I work as an intern at
  <a href="https://renci.org">RENCI</a>, where I create and deploy software that
  improves developer productivity within the organization. On the side, I'm
  learning Go and SvelteKit to keep my skills sharp.
