<h1>Hey, I'm Abel Lu ðŸ˜Ž</h1>
<p>
  I'm currently an undergrad at NC State University, where I study computer
  science with a focus on <b>full-stack development, DevOps, and cloud infrastructure</b>.
</p>
<p>
  Outside of school, I work as a Platform Engineering Intern at <a href="https://renci.org">RENCI</a>,
  where I create and deploy software that improves the developer experience within the
  organization.
</p>
<p>
  In my free time, I'm brushing up on <b>Go</b> and <b>Terraform</b> to keep my skills sharp.
